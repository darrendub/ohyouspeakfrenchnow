		<h5>Itinerary</h5>

		<h4>7:30pm</h4>  
		<p>Die-hard Drake bbs arrive at Paige’s house for early turn up. Playlist starts. Lights go down. We pop open a very expensive bottle of champagne that Paige was gifted for Christmas and we’re like yeah, 24 hour champagne diet starts now.</p><br>
		<p><b>Vibe:</b> “Crew Love”</p> ​ ​
		<div class="lyrics">
		<p><b>Lyrics we all sing:</b> 
		<i></i>Tell them I'mma need reservations for 20<br>
		I've never really been one for the preservation of money, nah<br>
		Much rather spend it all while I'm breathing<br>
		That OVO and that XO is everything you believe in, I know.
		</p> ​
		</div> 

		<h4>8:30pm</h4>  
		<p>We start texting our late bbs like, come and see me for once!! Late bbs hesitate. They’re not sure if they can turn up tonight. But then they’re like, you know what, live for today, plan for tomorrow, party tonight. Late bbs roll through and we all take shots to celebrate.</p><br>
		<p><b>Vibe:</b> “Big Rings”</p> ​
		<div class="lyrics">
		<p><b>Lyrics we all sing:</b> 
		​Cause I got a really big team<br>
		And they need some really big rings<br>
		They need some really nice things<br>
		Better be comin' with no strings
		</p> ​
		</div> ​ 

		<h4>9:30pm</h4>  
		<p>By now the pregame is v lit. We’re all vibing. We’re all dancing. It’s straight out of a Caribbean restaurant-turned-club and we’re all on our worst behavior. WORST.</p><br>
		<p><b>Vibe:</b> “Work”</p> ​
		<div class="lyrics">
		<p><b>Lyrics we all sing:</b> 
		​​He said me haffi<br>
		Work, work, work, work, work, work<br>
		He see me do mi<br>
		Dirt, dirt, dirt, dirt, dirt, dirt<br>
		So me put in<br>
		Work, work, work, work, work, work
		</p> ​
		</div>

		<h4>9:43pm</h4>  
		<p>At some point, we’re gonna be like, you know what this is too fun. How do we keep this vibe up into the night? How do we make sure it lasts? We finally understand Drake’s feels when he said: “It’s funny when you coming in first, but you hope that you’re last, you just hope that it last.” And then we remember: the key to more success is more Drake songs. Another one.</p><br>
		<p><b>Vibe:</b> “Back to Back”</p> ​
		<div class="lyrics">
		<p><b>Lyrics we all sing:</b> 
		​​IS THAT A WORLD TOUR OR YOUR GIRL’S TOUR?
		</p> ​
		</div>

		<h4>10:13pm</h4>  
		<p>It’s past 10—we have a Drake party to attend! We start calling Ubers, downing our drinks, and finding our jackets (don’t lose your jackets, bbs). We might be feeling a little more drunk than we should be, but you know what, we’re here for a good time, not a long time.</p><br>
		<p><b>Vibe:</b> “One Dance”</p> ​
		<div class="lyrics">
		<p><b>Lyrics we all sing:</b> 
		​​​That's why I need a one dance<br>
		Got a Hennessy in my hand<br>
		One more time 'fore I go<br>
		Higher powers taking a hold on me
		</p> ​
		</div>

		<h4>12:30am</h4>  
		<p>We’re at Mighty dancing so hard and everyone’s pretty jealous of us. But we’re kinda like sry, no new friends. Also, it’s May 1st now, almost May 2nd, which is Zoey’s birthday! Happy birthday, Zo!</p><br>
		<p><b>Vibe:</b> “Jumpman”</p> ​
		<div class="lyrics">
		<p><b>Lyrics we all sing:</b> 
		​​​If Young Metro don't trust you I'm gon' shoot you
		</p> ​
		</div>

		<h4>2:00am</h4>  
		<p>Whew! What a night bbs! Everyone heads back to Paige’s house for some good weed and white wine and reminisces about all the great times we had. Our feet hurt and we’re lying on the floor and we’re probably eating all the tings, but we’re still bobbin’ to the music.</p><br>
		<p><b>Vibe:</b> “The Ride”</p> ​
		<div class="lyrics">
		<p><b>Lyrics we all sing:</b> 
		​​​​You know its real when your latest nights are your greatest nights<br>
		The sun is up when you get home, that's just a way of life
		</p> ​
		</div>

		<h4>11:00am</h4>  
		<p>A night of drinking = hangover, but a night of drinking + Drake = horrible hangover. Prepare for the worst, bbs. Just remember that it was all worth it. And, just like the best cure for a hangover is usually to start drinking again, the best cure for the aftermath of a Drake party is another Drake song. Cue the last track.</p><br>
		<p><b>Vibe:</b> “In the Morning”</p> ​
		<div class="lyrics">
		<p><b>Lyrics we all sing:</b> 
		​​​​​Don't need a towel, we could dry off in the covers<br>
		And when you think you like it, I promise you gonna love it<br>
		Yeah, well lights coming through the drapes and we both yawning
		</p> ​
